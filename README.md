# Ansible PC setup

This is a collection of ansible scripts I use to setup my workstation as well as some of my servers. It is useful only to me, don't expect the cleanest code.

## How to use

1. `sudo apt install git`
1. Clone this repo
1. Run `sudo ./bootstrap` to install dependencies
1. If needed update the `inventory` file
1. Update the `vars/config.local` file
1. Create a file for the new PC

```bash
touch "install_$(hostname).yml"
```

1. Add the basics in the file

```yml
---
- hosts: local
 become: false
 vars_files:
   - "./vars/config.local"

 roles:
   - role: system/base
     become: yes
```

1. Add the roles as needed taking inspiration from the existing files
1. Run `./install` (`-C` allows to run in dry mode)
1. âš  Check the logs some tasks add a message saying what to do next

## Playbooks using secrets

The secrets are stored in [`/vars/secrets.yml.enc`](vars/secrets.yml.enc) which is managed with the built-in [`ansible-vault`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/vault_encrypting_content.html#encrypting-files-with-ansible-vault).

```bash
# The vault was not created with a --vault-id param
ansible-vault view vars/secrets.yml.enc
```

**The key for the file is in my Dashlane secure note "statox-setup secret file"**

To run a playbook using this the secrets:

- `ansible-playbook -e @vars/secrets.yml.enc --ask-vault-pass install_raccoon.yml`
- The variables in `vars/secrets.yml.enc` can be used as regular Ansible variables `{{ transmission_user }}`
- Note that for my docker-apps module I can create `*.j2` template files using the `{{ encrypted_variable }}` syntax, the module will copy the template and inject the variable

## TODO

- Handle desktop environement restart on first install
- Add new Github SSH key to known keys (prevent cloning dotfiles repo)
- Rework Firefox chrome (fails on first install because profile is not found)
- In dotfiles:
  - There seems to be a bug where the directories in `.config` are not created so the files can't be copied
  - Check how to execute the install from ansible
- warp and miro clients install are broken
- configure npm repository: Needs to create .npmrc file
- work/gitlab seems broken
- Check how to automatically setup Firefox sync
- zsh is not automatically enabled
- nvm, node and npm install missing
- Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy is hardcoded in several installations
- MysqlWorkbench installation seems to work fine the first time but fails when run again
- pnpm install `npm install -g pnpm@6`
