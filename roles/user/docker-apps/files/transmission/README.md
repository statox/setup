# Transmission

12/05/24: Tested only on an Ubuntu 22.04 hosted by dyjix the setup seems to be working BUT the web UI is broken (the name of the torrents don't match their data, and the progress bar keeps restarting). I'll need to figure that out next time I install that on a server.

## Usage

- In the `.env` file change the creds for the web UI and make sure the `TRANSMISSION_DATA_DIR` is a proper directory
