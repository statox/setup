# IMPORTANT:
# This role is used to install docker containers. Using a shell command
# is not the most reliable way (there is a community role to do that) but
# I want to keep this setup simple and galaxy requires some configuration.
#
# HOW TO USE:
# in the files/ directory of this role add a new directory [app_name]/
# in [app_name]/ create the docker-compose.yml of the new app to install
# in the items of this role add [app_name]/
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# For now docker-compose up returns '[container_name] is up-to-date]' in
# stderr
# So the first time the role runs it starts the containers and after that
# it runs `docker-compose up` again and that does nothing.
#
# The -p parameter allows to spawn all the containers under the same stack
#
# TODO:
#
# - Declare system/docker as a dependency to run only if docker is installed
# - Make item list a variable to configure from install playbook
