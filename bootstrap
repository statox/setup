## Usage:
#
# ./bootstrap
#
# This script installs the dependencies necessary to run the playbooks
#
# We use uv to manage the python dependencies and install ansible
# then we use ./run to access ansible easily
# The idea is to avoid installing ansible at the user level and keep install
# at the project level

# Get uv in the path

# Once ansible is installed install the plugins
# TODO There is probably a better way to do that
